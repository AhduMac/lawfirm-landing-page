            <h3>Blume & Grupp are partners in law & partners in life</h3>
            <p>Just want to clarify the thing we said up there: we are partners in life in a completely non-romantic way, ok? Back in our early days just out of law school we accidentally entered into a binding contract that has caused our lifeforce to be permanently intertwined on this plane of existance. </p>
